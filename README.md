Wi-Fi LED Message Display
Welcome to the Wi-Fi LED Message Display project! This project uses an ESP8266 module and an MD_MAX72xx LED Matrix to create a dynamic display that you can control via your web browser. It's perfect for displaying messages in your home, office, or any event where you want to broadcast information wirelessly.

Features
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Control the display from any device connected to the same network.
Customizable Scrolling Messages: Send messages to scroll across the LED matrix.
Easy Web Interface: A simple HTML form to send your messages.
Visual Indicators: Includes LED indicators for power and Wi-Fi status.
Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

Arduino IDE installed on your computer
Basic knowledge of electronics and programming with Arduino
Necessary components:
ESP8266 module
MD_MAX72xx LED Matrix
Breadboard and jump wires
USB cable
LEDs and resistors
Hardware Setup
ESP8266 Connections:

VCC to 3.3V
GND to Ground
CH_PD to 3.3V
MD_MAX72xx LED Matrix:

CS to D8
DIN to D7
CLK to D5
VCC to 3.3V
GND to Ground
LEDs:

Red LED to D1
Blue LED to D2
Note: Double-check all connections to avoid any damage to the components.

Software Setup
Library Installation:

Open Arduino IDE, go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries.
Install the following libraries:
ESP8266WiFi
MD_MAX72xx
Adafruit GFX Library
Loading the Sketch:

Copy the provided Arduino sketch into your Arduino IDE.
Connect the ESP8266 to your computer via the USB cable.
Select the correct board and port under the Tools menu.
Click Upload.
Usage
Once the sketch is uploaded and the hardware is set up:

Connect the ESP8266 to a power supply.
Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the ESP8266.
Use the web form to type your message and hit send.
Your message will now scroll across the LED matrix display.
